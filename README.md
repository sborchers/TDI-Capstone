## Success Prediction for Airbnb Listings, 2022

A real dataset with listing characteristics and reviews for over 38,000 Airbnb listings in New York City are explored, processed, and utilized to train a Supervised Machine Learning model to predict success probability of a listing. Success is measured by user review ratings. Data exploration and model interpretation findings provide actionable insights for Airbnb to increase listing success, as well as profitability.

The datasets used were obtained from Inside Airbnb, published by Murray Cox.
